# How to Solar Power Your Projects

## Basic Components of Off-grid PhotoVoltaic(PV) Systems

For most DC-based off-grid systems it really comes down to four main components – solar panels, charger controller, battery bank, and inverter (whenever needed for powering AC-based appliances). So let's take a look at them individually: 

### PV 
#### It produces electricity when exposed to light
![PV Panel](https://github.com/alexnathanson/solar-protocol/blob/17bf2e020b7f5992ba648b61bbfd3f9b7c1dcf36/wikimg/panel.png) 
_Photovoltaic Panel_

**Photovoltaic** means 'voltage from light' and refers to a solid-state semiconductor device, aka a solar cell, that produces a potential difference (Voltage) and current of electrons (Electricity) when exposed to light. PV panels, or modules, are made of multiple solar cells assembled between protective layers of glass and plastic, and typically framed in aluminum (for easy mounting). 

Using solar power is all about timing. Solar panels produce electricity when sunlight is shining on them, usually between 11 am to 4 pm (depnding on geolocation and seasonality). They provide more power when the sunlight is more intense and not reduced by cloud cover. They will produce some on a cloudy day, too, but typically much less efficiently (less than 10%) than what they would on a sunny day. And they don't produce at night (at least for now!).

The PV modules are available in a range of brands, sizes, and output capacity, and in some ways, they are easiest part to source in most markets. Look for modules with all the necessary approvals (UL, CE, or CSA labeled) and a 25-year warranty on their power output. 

### Charge controller 
#### It regulates the flow of electricity from PV modules to batteries
![Charge Controller](https://github.com/alexnathanson/solar-protocol/blob/17bf2e020b7f5992ba648b61bbfd3f9b7c1dcf36/wikimg/controllersm.png)
_Charge Controller_

The primary function of a charge controller is to regulate the flow of electric current from the array of solar modules to the batteries. This ensures the batteries are correctly charged and prevents damage from over-charging. Charge controllers come in different types (PWM vs MPPT) and range of capacities based on the voltage and current they can handle. 

A **PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) charge controller** regulates the flow of power from solar panels to batteries by rapidly switching the charge on and off to maintain optimal voltage and prevent overcharging. PWM CC tend to be much cheaper but offer less flexibility. A great feature to look for is high-voltage maximum power point tracking (MPPT). 

An **MPPT charge controller** can accept the input from the solar modules at high voltage and charge the batteries at an appropriate lower voltage, using an optimization algorithm to maximize the amount of power going to the battery bank.

### Battery 
#### It stores electricity
![Battery](https://github.com/alexnathanson/solar-protocol/blob/17bf2e020b7f5992ba648b61bbfd3f9b7c1dcf36/wikimg/batterysm.png)
_Battery_

The two most common types of batteries used in renewable energy systems are deep-cycle lead-acid batteries and lithium-ion batteries. Both types of batteries work well and provide dependable energy storage for off-grid solar power systems.

**Lead-acid batteries** have been used for well over a century. They're relatively more affordable and can provide plenty of electric currents. Lead-acid batteries last approximately ten years, or 1,500 cycles, providing they are well-maintained and used as directed. They are large, heavy, and require periodic maintenance. They contain a mix of a recycled and new lead, a toxic metal that must be recycled properly.

**Lithium-ion batteries** are lighter and smaller than lead-acid batteries. They are significantly higher in price to purchase than lead-acid batteries but require less maintenance, withstand deeper discharges, and last about 13 or more years, or 2000 cycles. Lithium-ion batteries are made from a mix of recycled and new lithium, a rare and reactive metal that must be recycled properly. They can be extremely sensitive to heat and need proper maintanance and in general can be less suitable for applications exposed to extreme weather and/or the elements. 

Make sure to check your local regulations and safety guidelines before using or transporting lithium-ion batteries.

### Inverter [Optional]
#### It converts direct current (DC) to alternating current ([AC](https://www.buildwithrise.com/stories/ac-dc-power)) suitable for home appliances
PV modules and batteries produce electricity in the form of direct current (DC). This can charge devices that use DC, like phones, tablets, and battery maintenance chargers. You can get DC lighting and appliances for your off-grid place, especially at motorhomes and sailing boat shops. But the most commonly available and affordable appliances run on alternating current (AC), and the wiring for AC in a building is more standard for electricians. A highly efficient device called an inverter can convert DC from your batteries to AC for your house wiring. For home use, there are two basic kinds of inverters: micro-inverters and string inverters.

## TL;TR

The core components of an off-grid solar system include the photovoltaic (PV) panel, battery, and charge controller. 

The **PV panel** converts sunlight into electricity, serving as the primary energy source for the system. <br>
The **battery** stores excess energy generated by the PV panel, providing power during periods without sunlight, such as at night or during cloudy weather. <br>
The **charge controller** optimizes the energy harvested from the PV panel, ensuring efficient charging of the battery by adjusting the voltage and current to match the system's needs.<br>

## Some Options to Solar Power Your Projects

When powering microcontrollers projects (Arduino, etc.) or single board computer projects (Raspberry Pi, etc.) with solar energy, there are a range of approaches depending on your needs, scale, and desired level of customization and uptime. 

Approaches can range from easy _plug-n-play kits_ to more experimental or educational builds, where you can assemble your own _solar recharging circuits_, or for ultra-efficient or intermittent applications, _low-power solar systems using supercapacitors_ can store just enough energy for short bursts of uptime, supporting lightweight and environmentally responsive designs.

## Low-power & Battery-less (Supercapacitors) 
[**The AEMSUCA**](https://www.tindie.com/products/jaspersikken/solar-harvesting-into-supercapacitors/) is a highly efficient solar powered supercapacitor charger with two regulated outputs designed by Jasper Sikken in the Netherlands. It is based on the [AEM10941 Solar Harvesting IC from E-peas](https://www.mouser.com/new/e-peas/e-peas-aem10941-solar-energy-harvesting-ic/?srsltid=AfmBOoonEYt0ZTCYKisSAj9F7xGoW5foGiZDyC6-fmOtXAsAiF072jqa).

<div align="center"><sub>The AEMSUCA board by Jasper Sikken.</sub></div>
<br>

This circuit converts solar energy from a small solar panel into energy stored in supercapacitors and even operates under indoor light. The board provides two regulated outputs that activate once the supercapacitor is sufficiently charged, along with a low-voltage warning that signals impending shutdown.

The [AEM10941 harvesting IC](https://www.mouser.com/new/e-peas/e-peas-aem10941-solar-energy-harvesting-ic/?srsltid=AfmBOoonEYt0ZTCYKisSAj9F7xGoW5foGiZDyC6-fmOtXAsAiF072jqa) is very suitable for indoor applications because it has an ultra low power startup. The IC gets most power out of the solar cells by doing MPPT maximum power point tracking every 5 seconds. The AEM10941 can charge a series of supercapacitors from indoor light but it is suitable ONLY for **very low power applications**.

**Supercapacitors** store energy electrostatically rather than chemically, allowing them to charge and discharge much faster than batteries. In solar applications, they capture and release energy efficiently during fluctuating sunlight conditions, making them ideal for powering low-energy or intermittent systems without the wear and degradation typical of batteries. Unlike batteries, supercapacitors store energy through physical charge separation rather than chemical reactions, giving them longer lifespans, faster charging, and making them a more sustainable option with fewer material and recycling concerns.

**Electrostatically** means that supercapacitors store energy by separating electric charges on two conductive plates, rather than through chemical reactions like in batteries. When voltage is applied, positive and negative charges build up on the plates and are held apart by a thin insulating layer (the dielectric or electrolyte), creating an electric field that stores energy.

## Solar Recharging Circuits 
Most small solar setups for microcontrollers use low-wattage panels connected to a charging circuit with lithium-polymer or lithium-ion batteries. Lithium-ion or lithium-polymer batteries are the standard choice for microcontrollers because they offer high energy density, stable voltage, and reliable rechargeable performance in a compact form. Unfortunately though, lithium-ion and lithium-polymer batteries are generally more suitable for indoor conditions, since they perform best within moderate temperature ranges and can be sensitive to extreme heat, cold, or direct sunlight.

Here are a couple of **recharging circuits** available from [Adafruit Industries](https://www.adafruit.com/search?q=solar): 

<div align="center"><img src="https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/390-06.jpg" alt="Small solar recharging board" width="60%" /></div>
<div align="center"><sub>Adafruit USB/DC/Solar Lithium-Ion/Polymer Charger.</sub></div>
<br>

[This circuit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/390) is designed specifically for solar charging, and will automatically draw the most current possible from the panel in any light condition. Even thought it isn't a 'true' MPPT (max power point tracker), it offers a similar performance. Adafruit offers [detailed tutorials on how to use this charger as well as documentation on how it all works](http://learn.adafruit.com/usb-dc-and-solar-lipoly-charger).

<div align="center"><img src="https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/4755-06.jpg" alt="Small solar recharging board" width="60%" /></div>
<div align="center"><sub>Adafruit Universal USB/DC/Solar Lithium-Ion/Polymer Charger.</sub></div>
<br>

[This charger](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4755) is an all-in-one circuit for all Lithium Polymer (LiPoly) or Lithium Ion (LiIon) rechargeable batteries. This Adafruit Universal USB/DC/Solar Lithium-Ion/Polymer Charger can use USB, DC or Solar power, with a wide 5-10V input Voltage range as well as a wide range of panels. The charger chip is designed to reduce the current draw if the input voltage starts to dip under 4.5V, making it similar to MPPT charge controllers. Even though this was designed with solar in mind, it also works with a plain USB or DC charger.

<div align="center"><sub>DF Robot Solar Power Manager 5V.</sub></div>
<br>

[DF Robot](https://www.dfrobot.com/search-solar.html) offers a [Solar Power Manager](https://www.dfrobot.com/product-1712.html) that can power 5V/1A devices through, yet again, a 3.7V Lithium battery charged via a 4.5-6V solar panel. The module also has various protections for the battery, solar panel and the output, which helps stability and safety.

There are other similar charging circuits around, but overall when it comes to recharging circuits make sure it is from a reputable source and that it is well documented **so you know exactly what kinds of applications, voltage and amperages it is rated to handle!**


## Plug-n-Play Kits 
For simple, ready-to-use setups, plug-and-play solar kits such as those from [**Voltaic Systems**](https://voltaicsystems.com/solar-panel-kits/)

>[!WARNING]
> **Reminder:** _When disconnecting the components of a solar system, always disconnect the Solar panel from the charge controller first (basically unplugging the power source), before disconnecting the battery!_

## For More
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Different locations and varying equipment needs will require adjustments to your choice of components, such as PV panel size, battery capacity, and charge controller specifications, to ensure optimal performance and system reliability under specific environmental and operational conditions. There is a bit of math to do in order to make sure you are matching the power demand of your devices, the battery capacity, size of the panel and capacity of the charge controller, but for lower power microcontrollers & single board computers you should be able to get away with one of the earlier options!
